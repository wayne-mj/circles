## Circles

A small program that perform various calculations on circular forms.  Originally written to demonstrate programming to my son.

Area, circumference, volume of sphere, and volume of cylinder.

As the need arises, I will add new features.

For reference, I sourced the formulas from the following websites:
- [Wikipedia - Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area)
- [Wikipedia - List of formulas in elementary geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_formulas_in_elementary_geometry)

And from my son's school homework.
